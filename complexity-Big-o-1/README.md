# INFS O(1)
Recreate a snake game with Complexity O(1) when playing.
Complexty of all (move - verification - ver Self-collision /functions) is O(1)
Complexty of Initialization of playing (start / function) is O(n)

Queue-data-structure for snake moving.. And a similar method to hashTable to verifie the Self-Collision.



# ELSE O(N)
[Show complexity bigO(N) Snake game](../complexity-Big-o-N)
